# TM-2---Language-Models-and-Analysis
Uses three different language model approaches to attempt to classify the genre of a song based on lyrics. Includes classes and methods for determining the performance of each language model.

How to run:
You will need to have the assignment2.py file located in a folder with the training set, the validation set, and the two test sets.
The whole folder should be opened in your IDE when running the code.
Lines 470 and 471 contain file paths that lead to the two test sets in the folder. These should be the only two lines you have to change
to get the code running properly.
All files that I used for training, validation, and testing will be provided in the assignment submission. It is important to use the same
sets that I used, or to at least have any custom sets be formatted the same (i.e. tsv file with specific formatting for test sets).
